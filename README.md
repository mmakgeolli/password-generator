# password-generator

Consists of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to make an online password generator

The parameters that I am trying to meet with this generator is:

When I click the button to generate a password, I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
When prompted for password criteria, I select which criteria to include in the password
When prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
When asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
When I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

This is a screenshot which shows what the page is supposed to look like when working correctly:
